# Rational Number Class and its Main Class
Few points are described through comments in the code
Default constructor → takes input from the user.
Parameterized constructor → sets numerator and denominator directly (without asking again).
Now it will only ask for input twice (once for each fraction), and won’t ask again when doing math.
You need to override toString() in your Rationalnumber class so it prints in numerator/denominator form.
